GOAL: Develop a Machine Learning Data-Driven Trading Algorithm able to:
-Detect the best moments and conditions to execute clientsâ€™ orders maximizing performance
- Combine several sources of information to input into the model to make the best final decision (e.g., technical analysis, fundamental analysis, historic data, daily prediction, news, economic events etc.)
-Use historic data to optimize the model
-Be based on an incremental learning approach (i.e., automatically keep updating the model as soon as new data becomes available)
